# Tests

There are some test created. Before running them, you need to manually create an empty database with the same schema as the one used in production.

This database should be named 'test\_{PRODUCTION_DB_NAME}' and should be accessible by the user specified in the config file.

You should use the script 'db/modify_test_db.py' to remove some tables that may generate conflict. DONT forget to
set .env under 'db' folder file with test db credentials.

To run the tests, under root directory

```
    cd backend/backend_django_project/
    python manage.py test --keepdb
```

# Docs

There's a file called 'schema.yml' under 'backend/docs/' with the API documentation. It follows the OpenApi specification. In order to generate the client, run the following command under 'backend/docs/':

```
    sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 -e SWAGGER_JSON=/schema.yml -v ${PWD}/schema.yml:/schema.yml swaggerapi/swagger-ui
```

Now open any web browser and type 'localhost:8080' to use the API client.
