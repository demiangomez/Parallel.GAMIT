    the output indices will match the labeling order of the input centroids.
    Note that `n_features` refers to the dimensionality of coordinate system,
    i.e., 2 for lat/lon, 3 for ECEF (Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed), etc.

    Parameters
    ----------

    coordinates : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Coordinates do not need to match what was used for the prior
        clustering; i.e., if 'Euclidean' was used to calculate the prior
        clustering in an X,Y,Z projection, those coordinates can be provided in
        spherical coordinates, provided that 'haversine' is selected for the
        `metric` parameter.
    centroids : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Coordinates of the cluster centroids; distance metric for centroids
        should match both `coordinates` and the `metric` parameter.
    metric : str or callable, default='euclidean'
        Metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn or
        scipy.spatial.distance can be used. If metric is a callable function,
        it is called on each pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value
        recorded. See scikit-learn documentation for additional details.

    Returns
    -------
    central_points_idxs : int array of shape (n_clusters,)
        Indices of the central most point for each cluster; indices match the
        `labels` ordering.

    """Expand cluster membership to include edge points of neighbor clusters

    Expands an existing clustering to create overlapping membership between
    clusters. Existing clusters are processed sequentially by looking up
    nearest neighbors as an intersection of the current cluster membership and
    all cluster's point membership.  Once the `overlap_points` for a given
    neighbor cluster have been determined and added to current cluster, the
    remainder of that neighboring cluster is removed from consideration and
    distance query is rerun, with the process repeating until a number of
    clusters equal to the `neighborhood` parameter is reached. For stability,
    only original points are included for subsequent neighborhood searches;
    that is, Nearest neighbor distances are run as the shortest distance from
    all **original** members of the current cluster.

    Function requires an initial vector of cluster labels from a prior
    clustering, and coordinates in an ordering that matches the labels. This
    function also assumes that all points have been assigned a label (i.e.,
    there are no unlabeled points, or points labeled as 'noise').

    Parameters
    ----------

    labels : ndarray of type int, and shape (n_samples,)
        Cluster labels for each point in the dataset from prior clustering.
    coordinates : ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        Coordinates do not need to match what was used for the prior
        clustering; i.e., if 'Euclidean' was used to calculate the prior
        clustering in an X,Y,Z projection, those coordinates can be provided in
        spherical coordinates, provided that 'haversine' is selected for the
        `metric` parameter.
    metric : str or callable, default='haversine'
        Metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn or
        scipy.spatial.distance can be used. Note that latitude and longitude
        values will need to be converted to radians if using the default
        'haversine' distance metric.

        If metric is a callable function, it is called on each pair of
        instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable should
        take two arrays as input and return one value indicating the distance
        between them. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less efficient
        than passing the metric name as a string.

        Use of "precomputed", i.e., a N-by-N distance matrix, has not been
        tested, nor have sparse matrices. These may or may not work.

        Valid values for metric are:

        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',
          'manhattan']

        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',
          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'mahalanobis',
          'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao', 'seuclidean',
          'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean', 'yule']

        Sparse matrices are only supported by scikit-learn metrics.  See the
        documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these metrics.

    neighborhood : int greater than or equal to 1, default=3
        Number of adjacent clusters to include when adding cluster membership
        overlap. Should be less than the number of unique cluster labels - 1.

    overlap_points : int greater than or equal to 1, default=2
        Should not exceed the size of the smallest cluster in `labels`.

    rejection_threshold : float, default=None
        Determines if any potential overlapping points should be rejected for
        being too far (from source centroid or nearest source edge point).
        Default of 'None' is equivalent to setting the threshold to infinity.
        Note that if value other than 'None' is used, there is no guarantee
        that all clusters will have overlap points added.

    Returns
    -------
    expanded_clusters : bool array of shape (n_clusters, n_coordinates)
        The updated labels, one-hot encoded. Each row is a boolean index to
        extract cluster membership for a given label. If labels are continuous
        integers starting at 0, then the row number will match the cluster
        label; if not, rows are ordered to monotonically increase from the
        smallest cluster label.

class BisectingQMeans(_BaseKMeans):
    """Bisecting Q-Means clustering; modified from sklearn Bisecting K-means.

    In contrast to Bisecting K-Means, Bisecting Q-Means clustering will infer
    the number of clusters based on a termination condition. For this
    implementation the bisecting termination occurs according to the minimum
    and optimum cluster sizes, which are set by the `opt_size` and
    `min_size` parameters respectively. The child cluster of the bisected
    root cluster with the biggest inertia as determined by SSE (Sum of Squared
    Errors) will be selected bisection-- provided that the child cluster
    exceeds the set `*clust_size` boundary conditions. Cluster bisection
    terminates when there are no child clusters remaining that fulfill the user
    set boundary conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_size : int, default=4
        The minimum acceptable cluster size. Clusters of size <= to this
        parameter will **not** be produced by this algorithm.

    opt_size : int, default=12
        Target optimum cluster size. If the sum membership of a proposed
        cluster bisection is less than this value, the cluster will not be
        bisected. When combined with the `min_size` parameter above,
        these conditions together mean that clusters of sizes smaller than
        (`opt_size` - `min_size`) are *a priori* ineligible to be
        bisected.

    max_size: int, default=25
        Hard cutoff to bypass the heuristic when bisecting clusters; no
        clusters greater than this size will be produced.

    init : {'k-means++', 'random'} or callable, default='random'
        Method for initialization:

        'k-means++' : selects initial cluster centers for k-mean
        clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence. See section
        Notes in k_init for more details.

        'random': choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data
        for the initial centroids.

        If a callable is passed, it should take arguments X, n_clusters and a
        random state and return an initialization.

    n_init : int, default=1
        Number of time the inner k-means algorithm will be run with different
        centroid seeds in each bisection.
        That will result producing for each bisection best output of n_init
        consecutive runs in terms of inertia.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Determines random number generation for centroid initialization
        in inner K-Means. Use an int to make the randomness deterministic.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

    max_iter : int, default=300
        Maximum number of iterations of the inner k-means algorithm at each
        bisection.

    verbose : int, default=0
        Verbosity mode.

    tol : float, default=1e-4
        Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference
        in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations  to declare
        convergence. Used in inner k-means algorithm at each bisection to pick
        best possible clusters.

    copy_x : bool, default=True
        When pre-computing distances it is more numerically accurate to center
        the data first. If copy_x is True (default), then the original data is
        not modified. If False, the original data is modified, and put back
        before the function returns, but small numerical differences may be
        introduced by subtracting and then adding the data mean. Note that if
        the original data is not C-contiguous, a copy will be made even if
        copy_x is False. If the original data is sparse, but not in CSR format,
        a copy will be made even if copy_x is False.

    algorithm : {"lloyd", "elkan"}, default="lloyd"
        Inner K-means algorithm used in bisection.
        The classical EM-style algorithm is `"lloyd"`.
        The `"elkan"` variation can be more efficient on some datasets with
        well-defined clusters, by using the triangle inequality. However it's
        more memory intensive due to the allocation of an extra array of shape
        `(n_samples, n_clusters)`.

    n_clusters : int, default=2
        The number of clusters to seed prior to recursively bisecting. This
        parameter is updated at inference time and will reflect the number of
        clusters identified after calling `fit`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    cluster_centers_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
        Coordinates of cluster centers. If the algorithm stops before fully
        converging (see ``tol`` and ``max_iter``), these will not be
        consistent with ``labels_``.

    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Labels of each point.

    inertia_ : float
        Sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center,
        weighted by the sample weights if provided.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.
