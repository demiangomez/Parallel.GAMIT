pom170921: Added new global subnet methods.
pom210921:
- Added comments
- Changed the brackets around the dist variable, instead of checking the
  truth of dist it was checking that the list contained a value instead.
  Should fix far away stations from being added.
- Added a distance check to the tie station assignment. Only stations
  within 1 Earth radius linear distance will be added to the ties.
- When checking for stations that werenâ€™t assigned to a subnet, I mistakenly
  included the backbone stations which caused duplicate entries in some
  subnets.
pom220921:
- Changed 'if not iterate or len(points) <= BACKBONE_NET:' to
  'if not iterate or len(points[n_mask]) <= BACKBONE_NET:'
  so only the masked stations are counted when comparing against the desired
  number of backbone stations.
- Added the geocenter to the backbone delaunay triangulation.
pom011021:
- Set a minimum number of subnets, the program will reduce the minimum number
  of stations per subnet until the minimum number of subnets is created. All
  changes are in the subnets_delaunay routine.
