# Welcome to Parallel.GAMIT

**Parallel.GAMIT** is a powerful Python package designed to streamline and accelerate the processing of GPS data for geodetic applications, using MIT's GAMIT/GLOBK software. This repository focuses on parallelizing the workflow, allowing for efficient utilization of computing resources and significantly reducing the time required for complex data analyses.

Developed by [Demian Gomez](https://github.com/demiangomez) and contributors, Parallel.GAMIT provides a framework to manage and run multiple GAMIT jobs in parallel, optimizing processing times and enabling researchers to handle large datasets with ease. Parallel.GAMIT also integrates with **PostgreSQL**, a robust relational database management system, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of GNSS data, logs, and results. This integration ensures a scalable, organized data handling solution, especially beneficial for large-scale projects.

Key features of Parallel.GAMIT include:

- **Data Preparation**: Efficiently prepare data for parallel processing with GAMIT/GLOBK. Using Parallel.GAMIT's webfront and REST-API, users can easily visualize the data and metadata being processed.
- **Parallel Execution**: Run GAMIT processing tasks concurrently to maximize computational throughput.
- **Database Integration**: Store and manage data in PostgreSQL for enhanced accessibility and organization.
- **Error Handling and Monitoring**: Built-in tools for error detection and log management, ensuring robust and smooth operations.

With Parallel.GAMIT, you can expedite the traditionally time-consuming steps of GPS data processing, paving the way for faster analysis and decision-making. Whether you're a geophysicist, a researcher in tectonics, or a geodesist, this package offers a practical solution for handling high-volume GNSS data efficiently.
